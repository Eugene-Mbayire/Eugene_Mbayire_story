    <p>I was born in the DRC and lost my mother when I was just four years old. Growing up without a mother was never easy. But through those early challenges, I developed strength and independence that have guided me ever since.</p>

      <p>Didine, you were more than just my cousin — you became a big sister, a friend, and sometimes even a second mother. When life was hard, you stepped in with a soft heart and strong hands. You cared for me and my little sister like we were your own. You made sure we never missed school, even when it wasn’t your responsibility. You gave us love, comfort, and protection when we needed it most. I’ll never forget what you did for us — it’s written in my heart. Thank you for being that quiet hero in our childhood. I’ll carry your care and kindness with me always.
