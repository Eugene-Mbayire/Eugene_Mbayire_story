  This moment captured with my wonderful guests at Akagera National Park means so much to me. I've had the privilege of visiting the park a couple of times before, but sharing this experience with you truly was a highlight above all others. Your kindness and conversations made the day unforgettable.—

Thank you so much for the generous $100 tip.—
You made my day great, and I’m grateful to have been part of your journey here. Wishing you many more amazing adventures ahead!
