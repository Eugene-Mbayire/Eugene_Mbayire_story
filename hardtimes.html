    <p>Life wasn't always easy. After my mother passed, life threw many challenges at me. I worked as a driver since 2017 to support myself, and now, while studying software engineering, I’m building a better future for my family.</p>

      <p>Mama, I was only four when you left, too young to understand, but old enough to feel the emptiness. I was not able to have a photo with you — I just remain with this one picture, and I hold it close. It’s the only image I have, but your face lives in my heart. Every time I hear stories about you — your love, your strength, your kindness — I cry, even though I’ve grown into a man. I miss you in ways words can’t explain. I wish you could see the person I’ve become. I carry your name, your memory, and your love with me every day.

      <p>You were more than an aunt—you were my second mother, my shelter when I had none. After Mom left, you gave me love, guidance, and strength. Everything I am today is part of your legacy. I miss you deeply, every day. Rest in peace, Mama. March 2024 took you, but my heart keeps you forever.

      <p>You were more than an uncle — you became the father figure I needed when life turned dark. After Mom left, you gave me love, protection, and quiet strength. You never spoke much, but your actions raised me into the man I am today. I carry your values with me always. Rest well, Dad(Nyombayire Pierre). Your kindness shaped my life forever.</p>

Just encountered one of your Mathematics writtens.<br>
      <img src="old_images/Screenshot11.png"  height="300px" width="250px">
      <p>I came across this paper today, and it immediately reminded me of how much you loved Mathematics. Looking back, I wish I had been wise enough to learn from you when I had the chance. I didn’t realize then what a blessing your knowledge and patience were. I carry that regret — but also deep gratitude for all the love and wisdom you shared with me in your quiet way.</p>

  Though I never had the chance to meet you, big sister, I’ve always felt your quiet presence in our family. You left this world before I was even born — taken too soon in a tragic accident at home, when you were still just a baby. Every time I hear the story, my heart aches for the moments we never got to share. I imagine the laughter we could’ve had, the bond we could’ve built. You are not forgotten — you are part of me, part of our story, and I carry your memory with tenderness and love. Rest peacefully, my sister. I’ll always wonder who you would have become.
