    <p>A journey of strength, love, and hope – by Mbayire Eugene</p>
  </header>

  <section class="story">
    <h2>Quick Story Resume</h2>
    <p>My name is Mbayire Eugene. I'm 32 years old, born in DRC. My mother passed away when I was four. I didn't grow up in a wealthy family, but I was raised with love and courage. I'm currently studying software engineering, while working as a driver since 2017. I married my lovely wife Kayitesi Yvonne in October 2023, and we had our first son, Imena Nganji Mbayire, in March 2024.</p>

      <p>You were more than an aunt—you were my second mother, my shelter when I had none. After Mom left, you gave me love, guidance, and strength. Everything I am today is part of your legacy. I miss you deeply, every day. Rest in peace, Mama. March 2024 took you, but my heart keeps you forever.

      It was in 2020, when He was sick at home(Remera/Prince house).<br>

      <p>You were more than an uncle — you became the father figure I needed when life turned dark. After Mom left, you gave me love, protection, and quiet strength. You never spoke much, but your actions raised me into the man I am today. I carry your values with me always. Rest well, Dad(Nyombayire Pierre). Your kindness shaped my life forever.</p>

      <img src="old_images/Screenshot11.png"  height="300px" width="250px">
      <p>I came across this paper today, and it immediately reminded me of how much you loved Mathematics. Looking back, I wish I had been wise enough to learn from you when I had the chance. I didn’t realize then what a blessing your knowledge and patience were. I carry that regret — but also deep gratitude for all the love and wisdom you shared with me in your quiet way.</p>

It was around 1980's.<br>

      <p>Mama, I was only four when you left, too young to understand, but old enough to feel the emptiness. I was not able to have a photo with you — I just remain with this one picture, and I hold it close. It’s the only image I have, but your face lives in my heart. Every time I hear stories about you — your love, your strength, your kindness — I cry, even though I’ve grown into a man. I miss you in ways words can’t explain. I wish you could see the person I’ve become. I carry your name, your memory, and your love with me every day.

      <p>Dad, when Mom left this world, you stayed strong for me and all my siblings. Even when resources were so limited, you gave me love, protection, and reasons to smile. I never saw you give up — you always found a way to keep me safe and happy. I may not have understood everything then, but I see it all now. And today, I want you to know: it’s my turn to take care of you, to bring you the joy you deserve. I will do my best to make you proud and keep you smiling until the very end. Thank you for everything, Papa.

      <p>Didine, you were more than just my cousin — you became a big sister, a friend, and sometimes even a second mother. When life was hard, you stepped in with a soft heart and strong hands. You cared for me and my little sister like we were your own. You made sure we never missed school, even when it wasn’t your responsibility. You gave us love, comfort, and protection when we needed it most. I’ll never forget what you did for us — it’s written in my heart. Thank you for being that quiet hero in our childhood. I’ll carry your care and kindness with me always.

  Dear, little sis Aline I just realized that you are the oldest of all my female friends. No matter the arguments we’ve had, the truth is that I’ve always loved you. You’ve stood by me through the years with a heart full of love and patience. You’re not just my sister — you’re the strongest parts of who I am. I’m so grateful for you. May life keep rewarding your beautiful soul.

<p>
  Zamiri, you’re not just my big brother — you’re my shield, my example, my quiet strength. Through every season, you’ve stood tall, never letting life’s challenges shake your loyalty or your love. I’ve watched you fight silent battles, yet you never gave up. You’ve made this brotherhood something deep and unbreakable, and I thank you for always holding us together. I want you to know, no matter what comes — I’ll always be by your side, just like you’ve been by mine. You’re more than a brother, you’re my blessing.

      This screenshots means more than just faces on a screen — it holds love, unity, and the power of family. Thank you, my dear siblings, for showing up, for the laughter, the wisdom, and the warmth in our conversation. It reminded me how strong we are when we stand together. Most of all, thank you for keeping our beloved Dad smiling and proud. He deserves every joy, and you all helped give him that. Let’s make Mbayire family the best family and keep holding each other close, no matter the distance.

  Though I never had the chance to meet you, big sister, I’ve always felt your quiet presence in our family. You left this world before I was even born — taken too soon in a tragic accident at home, when you were still just a baby. Every time I hear the story, my heart aches for the moments we never got to share. I imagine the laughter we could’ve had, the bond we could’ve built. You are not forgotten — you are part of me, part of our story, and I carry your memory with tenderness and love. Rest peacefully, my sister. I’ll always wonder who you would have become.

  With my soulmate wife(Kayitesi)_ in the beggining of 2023 somewhere in the hills of Kigali (on our first date)<br>

<p>
  When I look at this photo of us , I see more than just two people together — I see a partnership built on love, respect, and deep understanding. My love, you have this beautiful way of standing beside me in every dream I chase, every plan I make, whether it’s clear or still unfolding. You never ask me to change — instead, you give me the space to grow, and I admire how confidently you stay true to yourself, too. That honesty, that realness, is part of what makes me love you more every day.

I don’t say it enough, but I see how you love — gently, deeply, and with purpose. And I feel it in all the quiet ways you support me. You’re not just the woman I married — you’re my teammate, my peace, my best friend. The way we understand each other without even needing too many words — that’s rare. You and I… we are a perfect match, not because we’re the same, but because we fit where it truly matters. I thank God for you every single day.

      <p>When I held Imena Nganji Mbayire in my arms for the first time on the 09th March 2024, I knew my life had changed forever.</p><br>
      <p>
        This photo means everything to me — a moment of pure blessing: my loving wife, and our precious baby boy, Imena Nganji Mbayire. The day you came into our lives, I felt something inside me shift. I held you close, and I knew right then that you were going to carry not just my love, but my name, my dreams, and my hopes for a better future.

I named you MBAYIRE — my own name, a name I proudly received from your grandfather. It carries history, strength, and responsibility. It means a lot, my son, and I want you to know it is not just a name — it’s a legacy. Never take it for granted. Carry it with pride, and always make sure you live in a way that honors it. I hope one day, your children will inherit it too, just as I did.

Your mother gave you the name Imena — a powerful and beautiful name. Always live in a way that reflects its meaning. Be strong in character, and grounded in purpose.

My son, I wish you a life full of peace, wisdom, humility, and boldness. Grow into a man who is kind and fearless, respectful and brave. We will raise you with all the love we have, and I promise to always be there — not just to guide you, but to learn from you too. You are already a blessing, and I know your life will continue to be one to many.

This is only the beginning, my boy — but what a powerful beginning it is. We love you endlessly.
