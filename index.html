    <h2>Quick Story Resume</h2>
    <p>My name is Mbayire Eugene. I'm 32 years old, born in DRC. My mother passed away when I was four. I didn't grow up in a wealthy family, but I was raised with love and courage. I'm currently studying software engineering, while working as a driver since 2017. I married my lovely wife Kayitesi Yvonne in October 2023, and we had our first son, Imena Nganji Mbayire, in March 2024.</p>

      <p>You were more than an aunt—you were my second mother, my shelter when I had none. After Mom left, you gave me love, guidance, and strength. Everything I am today is part of your legacy. I miss you deeply, every day. Rest in peace, Mama. March 2024 took you, but my heart keeps you forever.
